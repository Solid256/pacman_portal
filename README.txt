This is Pacman Portal, a game I made in python with pygame for my intro to game dev class. The game is 100% complete and free to play.

To play, click on the pacman_portal.zip folder in the repository, then click the grey download button. Extract the folder and there should be an exe named pacman_portal.exe. That there is the game. Enjoy!

To reset the high scores, delete the old high_scores.bin file and copy and paste the high_scores_reset.bin file. Rename the file high_scores.bin.

All code, sprites and music are entirely custom, except the font. This game took about 2 weeks to produce. This is my first time making my own Pac-Man style game, and so I put a lot of heart into it, seeing as I was once a fan of the series when I was a kid.

Pac-Man belongs to Namco and Portal belongs to Valve.
